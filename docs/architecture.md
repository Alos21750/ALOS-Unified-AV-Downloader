# Architecture and source layout

UAV Downloader uses a `src` layout so runtime packages, build
files, documentation, and tests have explicit boundaries.

```text
src/uav_downloader/
  apps/          UAV Browser and UAV Watcher desktop applications
  cli/           UAV Downloader CLI and command-line argument handling
  core/          configuration, paths, migration, SSL, updater, crash logging
  entrypoints/   Windows and installed application entrypoints
  i18n/          application strings and site labels

## Public entrypoints

- `uav-browser` → `uav_downloader.entrypoints.browse:main`
- `uav-watcher` → `uav_downloader.entrypoints.watch:main`
- `uav-downloader-cli` → `uav_downloader.cli.headless:main`

Both Windows entrypoints install shared runtime guards before importing GUI or
subtitle dependencies. This keeps SSL certificate setup, crash reporting, and
the frozen translation diagnostic consistent.

## Site boundary

`uav_downloader.sites` owns the current registry and exposes canonical
`validate_url` and `create_site` functions. Misspelled v2 aliases remain only
as compatibility shims. Each supported site implementation shares the crawler
contract, quality preference, proxy settings, naming rules, and download
worker limits.

## Persistence boundary

New user data belongs under `UAV Downloader`; legacy locations are
read only as migration sources. Migration is copy-only, skips links, never
deletes old data, and never overwrites a file already present at the new
location.

## Release boundary

Windows release bytes are produced by pinned CI and then verified as the same
bytes through artifact download, release upload, checksums, and attestations.
Canonical v3 assets and legacy aliases are both generated from that one build.
